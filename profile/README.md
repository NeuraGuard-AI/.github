### What's NeuraGuard?
We're tiny team hacking together. Right now, we're in MVP mode. 

---

### What we're Cooking 
- **Self-hostable** AI models
- **Plain-English** threat explanations 
- **One-click** deployment 

---

### Why Bother? 
Big tech's solutions are overpriced and overcomplicated. We're building: 
- **Cheap enough for startups**, powerful enough for enterprises.
- **Tools you can actually self-host.**
- **Docs that don't make you cry.**

### Wanna help? 
We're looking for:
- 🐞 Beta testers: [IT teams under attack]
